## Hi, this is the readme file for our data visualization class project: IS590DV
### Team Members: Rishabh Mulani, Ashley Hetrick, Monica Porteanu, Pravesh Humane

The ipython notebook (jupyter notebook) contains many interactive visualizations which use ipywidgets, bqplot and plotly. As some of these interactive visualizations do not render correctly on Github or even nbviewer, I advise you to download the jupyter notebook and follow the instructions within.

##### Happy visualizing!
